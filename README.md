# Polkapet Community Project

The world where you can feel free to be creative
Let take a look project whitepaper [Whitepaper](https://lwc-polkapet.gitbook.io/white-paper/) 
Or checkout the demo site https://polkapet.vercel.app/  :rocket:


The idea is inspired by the movie The Golden Compass when in the world each person has their mascot to express their personality. Therefore, Limitless Creature World is born. Limitless Creature World is where you feel free to be creative. A creative world is based on the Polkapet game.  Polkapet (Polkadot + Pet) is an NFT game that is built on the Substrate of Polkadot. Each NFT is an animal that is designed based on your personality. Almost all users of web2 play the game and based on the Polkapet game, we open the doors of web3 to everyone.


## Getting Started

Depending on your operating system and Rust version, there might be additional packages required to compile this template.
Check the [Install](https://docs.substrate.io/install/) instructions for your platform for the most common dependencies.
Alternatively, you can use one of the [alternative installation](#alternatives-installations) options.

### Build

Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs

After you build the project, you can use the following command to explore its parameters and subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/node-template -h
```

You can generate and view the [Rust Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-doc.html) for this template with this command:

```sh
cargo +nightly doc --open
```

### Single-Node Development Chain

The following command starts a single-node development chain that doesn't persist state:

```sh
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

To purge the development chain's state, run the following command:

```sh
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

To start the development chain with detailed logging, run the following command:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -ldebug --dev
```

Development chains:

- Maintain state in a `tmp` folder while the node is running.
- Use the **Alice** and **Bob** accounts as default validator authorities.
- Use the **Alice** account as the default `sudo` account.
- Are preconfigured with a genesis state (`/node/src/chain_spec.rs`) that includes several prefunded development accounts.


### Connect with Polkadot-JS Apps Front-End

After you start the node template locally, you can interact with it using the hosted version of the [Polkadot/Substrate Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) front-end by connecting to the local node endpoint.
A hosted version is also available on [IPFS (redirect) here](https://dotapps.io/) or [IPNS (direct) here](ipns://dotapps.io/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer).
You can also find the source code and instructions for hosting your own instance on the [polkadot-js/apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) repository.
